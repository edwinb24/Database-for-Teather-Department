# Database-for-Teather-Department
Consist of:
Design database system for Lindenwood University’s theater department to enroll students on and off campus, record students' information, and maintain information regarding majors.

Notes:
This program is the biggest project that I participate as a student on. It consist on a team of other three developers and the development was over a period of around four months. While it was a student project it was developt as a contractual project for the theater department of Lindenwood University. The head of the faculty was the client, and we usually meet with her once to twice a week to let her known our progress in the project and discuss features. They require the ability of being able to access to the students information from any computer on the faculty so CD's witht the software, instalation instructions, and a manual where distribute between the professors of the faculty. All of the extra files are in the repositorie with the exception of the project manual and the timeline. The software also was require to work remotly, so a feature to recolect student information while offline was add to the project. Once the project was done and submitted, the IT department of Lindenwood University took over the management of the project. The project was still being use when I finish my undergrad on 2012. 

Tools: MySQL, Visual Basic, Microsoft Office 2007, Windows 7
Technical:
• The tables for the database could be found in the "csc425proj tables.pdf" file.
• When we were developing the software the IT department provide us with a PC that we install in the clients office with the intention of being use as the server in the development period (my team was unable to access the cloud system of the university because such information is restricted to students).
• The software work with a database that operates with an encrypted password and a cloud-connected computer within the servers of the theater department
• Facilitate the population of Excel spreadsheets from the database
• Allow the use of Excel to keep information of students while offline, and then populate the data when online again
