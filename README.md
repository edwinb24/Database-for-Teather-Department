# Database-for-Theater-Department
Consists of:
This project is a database system for Lindenwood University’s theater department to enroll students on and off campus, record students' information, and maintain information regarding majors.
Notes:
This program is the biggest project that I participated in as a student. I worked with a team of three other developers and the development was over a period of around four months. While it was a student project, it was developed as a contractual project for the theater department of Lindenwood University. The head of the faculty was the client, and we usually met with her once or twice a week to let her know our progress in the project and discuss features. The client required the ability to access the students’ information from any computer of the faculty, so CD's with the software, installation instructions, and a manual were distributed between the professors of the faculty. All of the extra files are in the repository, with the exception of the project manual and the timeline. The software also needed to work remotely, so a feature to recollect student information while offline was added to the project. Once the project was done and submitted, the IT department of Lindenwood University took over the management of the project. The project was still being used when I finished my undergraduate studies in 2012. 
Tools: MySQL, Visual Basic, Microsoft Office 2007, Windows 7
Technical:
• The tables for the database could be found in the "csc425proj tables.pdf" file.
• When we were developing the software, the IT department provided us with a PC that we installed in the client’s office with the intention of being used as the server in the development period (my team was unable to access the cloud system of the university because such information is restricted to students).
• The software worked with a database that operates with an encrypted password and a cloud-connected computer within the servers of the theater department.
• It facilitates the population of Excel spreadsheets from the database.
• The program allows the use of Excel to keep information of students while offline, and then populate the data when online again.
